# DUO STUDIO
 Frontend clone of the DUO Studio website, showcasing modern UI/UX design principles and responsive design. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with animation libraries such as GSAP, ScrollTrigger, and Locomotive Scroll to replicate the original site's user interface and interactive elements, including smooth scrolling and custom scroll-based animations.
